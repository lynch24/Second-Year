## Introduction

This directory contains any files associated with your report.  Note: if you are producing a video _do not_ upload an `mp4` file here.  The _gitlab instance_ in the _School of Computing_ doesn't have unlimited capacity.  You should use YouTube or Google Drive for large files, and add links to them in this readme.

You may feel free to store documents such as word files, PowerPoint, images etc. here if you wish to keep track of things.  Again though: _Do not store video files here_.
